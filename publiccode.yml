    longDescription: |
      The portal PRENOTAZIONI is a web portal that allows you to book the
      various services offered by an institution.


      The portal consists of a "user" part in which the various bookable
      services are published and which, through a guided procedure, allows users
      to book the desired service,


      on the one hand "admin" with which administrators can easily define the
      bookable services and booking methods and on the one hand
      "user\_backoffice" with which the employee can download the list of
      appointments in order to better organize his work.


      The portal uses arango, a semantic repository, a NoSQL database system
      used for data storage, queries and management.
